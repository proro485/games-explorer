## Features
1. Extremely responsive and mobile friendly design made possible by TailwindCSS.
2. Browse your popular, upcoming and new games and know more about them.
3. Website is quite minimal, simple to navigate and demonstrates good usage of React Router DOM.
4. Nice looking loading animations made possible by React Spinners with help from RTK Query which gives us <strong>isLoading</strong> variable through destructuring of fetch request making it easier to implement conditional rendering.
